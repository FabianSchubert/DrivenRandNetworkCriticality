Please place the text of your poster abstract here.
The paper format is A4, the font is Times New Roman, font size is 12, line spacing is 1.15, and the text must be fully justified.
The top, left, and right margins are \unit[2.5]{cm}, the bottom margin is \unit[3]{cm}.
Poster abstracts have to be in English and must not exceed one page, including references.
References are cited according to this example~\cite{katja2013}.
Citing several references at the same time should be done like this~\cite{katja2013,till2012} or like this~\cite{katja2013,till2012,katja2011,smeddinck2015}.
Please follow these instructions closely in order to make the final abstracts look as uniform as possible.
Do not change any fonts, font sizes, margins, or the spacing between paragraphs.
Abstracts not adhering to this template will be rejected and we will ask you to correct them.

After you have prepared your abstract according to these guidelines (MS Word is highly recommended), generate a PDF file, name it according to the family name of the first author (e.g. Einstein.pdf) and submit it to \textbf{poster@interdisciplinary-college.de} until \textbf{February 15 2019}, including institutional postal and email address of the presenting author.
The abstracts will be part of the electronic IK proceedings, which need to be prepared and compiled in due time.
Therefore, we cannot accept any late submissions of poster abstracts.
Note, that a poster can only be presented if the accompanying abstract has been accepted before IK.
We will try to let you know within two days of submission whether your abstract is accepted.
