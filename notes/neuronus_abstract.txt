Echo state networks (ESNs) have proven to be a powerful tool in the field of time series prediction. The spectral radius of the synaptic weight matrix provides a measure to regulate these networks into an appropriate working regime. However, for ESNs to serve as an abstraction of biological networks, directly tuning the spectral radius is not a plausible mechanism. We show that the spectral radius can be regulated by local homeostasis, using the variance of neural activity and the variance of the membrane potential corresponding to recurrent inputs. The latter implies that our model relies on the assumption that external and recurrent input signals can be treated as two separate streams of information. We demonstrate the importance of this separation by means of the network performance, quantified by a non-linear memory recall task. The homeostatic control modulates a gain factor acting on the recurrent input and is biologically plausible in the sense that it only relies on locally available information. While theoretically it only yields precise tuning for statistically independent external driving across nodes, numerical experiments suggest that it also holds under less restrictive conditions.
